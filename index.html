      <p>
        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
        physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
        Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
        far beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
        potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
        for a prodigiously violent instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
        heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
        mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
        irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
        beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>

      <p>
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
        and drew a double box around it.
      </p>

      <p>
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
        that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
        hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
        time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
        John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
        detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
        waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
        when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
        second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
        inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
        correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
        many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
        comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
        apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
        and space and energy to science and speculation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
        billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
        galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
        extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
        universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
        into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
      </p>
      <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>
      <p>
        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
        operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
        accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
        Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
        waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
        should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins
        University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
        said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a
        signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
        gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint
        spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space
        and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
        and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators,
        working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
        Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a
        scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and
        in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
        in 10 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not
        expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been
        lucky.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth
        of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr.
        Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
        with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of
        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in
        1979), in his office last week.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as
        scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he
        tended his radio telescopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the
        most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in
        1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
        Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
        knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the news.
